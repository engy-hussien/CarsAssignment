## Description

listing API and getting simunlotsly updates

## Architicture
- There are several patterns can be used while implementing this task.
- I chose MVP as i prefer it more than MVC due to it's base structure.
- It's gives me capapbility to write more clear, well organized code and avoiding large files content.
- I've also used protocols as i love to implement it due to its easy and wide function

## Lazy Loading
- I've chosen to download images this way as it's more efficient in memory and performance
- using rhird parties like ( Alamofire, Kingfisher ) caused big increase in memory.
